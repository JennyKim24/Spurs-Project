    General Manager Plan for the San Antonio Spurs:

    1. **Strengths**:
        - Victor Wembanyama's generational talent as a versatile big man who can dominate offensively and defensively.
        - A young core with high potential, including Devin Vassell, Keldon Johnson, Jeremy Sochan, Julian Champagne.
        - Strong coaching staff led by Gregg Popovich, with a history of player development and success.

    2. **Weaknesses**:
        - Lack of veteran leadership to guide the rookies during critical moments.
        - Inconsistent three-point shooting and perimeter defense.
        

    3. **Plan for the 24-25 Season**:
        - **Trade or Free Agency**:
            - Pursue a veteran point guard (e.g., Derrick White, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Edwards-type player) to provide elite floor spacing and improve shot creation.
            - Sign a consistent three-point shooter to space the floor for Wembanyama and others.
            - Stephan Castle has a lot of potential, develop him as a point guard. 
            - Need good rotational players
        
        - **Draft Strategy**:
            - Focus on acquiring a dynamic wing player who can defend multiple positions and contribute offensively.
        
        - **Player Development**:
            - Develop Jeremy Sochan as a secondary playmaker to complement Wembanyama.
            - Work on improving Wembanyama's physicality to handle NBA-level centers.
        
        - **Rotation Optimization**:
            - Build lineups that maximize Wembanyamaâ€™s versatility, pairing him with stretch forwards and defensive wings.
            - Utilize analytics to manage player minutes and reduce the risk of injuries.

        - **Long-Term Goals**:
            - Develop the young core into a playoff-contending team over the next two years.
            - Leverage cap flexibility to sign another star player to pair with Wembanyama during his prime.
